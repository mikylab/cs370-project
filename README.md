This is a Python script for a Twitter bot. It is designed to be run on a Raspberry Pi with an internet connection, a button, and a camera module. The CSV file is read by the Python script, and a different CSV file could be used for the selection of different phrases. The script can easily be running using the preinstalled default editor Thonny.
